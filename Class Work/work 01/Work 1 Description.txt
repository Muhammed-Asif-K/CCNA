Lab: Interdepartmental IP Routing (PC1 â†” PC2 and PC3)

Objective

The objective of this lab is to configure IP addressing and static routing across multiple departments in an organization so that devices in one department can communicate with others.

Specifically, the requirement was to ensure successful ping communication:

 From PC1 (HR department) to PC2 and PC3 (Sales department)
 And also from PC2 and PC3 back to PC1

Network Layout Overview

The organization consists of six departments, each assigned to its own subnet:

HR â€“ 192.168.1.208/28
SALES â€“ 192.168.1.0/25
FINANCE â€“ 192.168.1.192/28
IT â€“ 192.168.1.128/27
MARKETING â€“ 192.168.1.160/27
MANAGEMENT â€“ 192.168.2.0/29

Each department has its own LAN connected to a Layer 2 switch, which is connected to a router interface.

There are three main routers in this design:

 R1 connects to HR and FINANCE
 R2 connects to SALES and IT
 R3 connects to MARKETING and MANAGEMENT

All routers are interconnected using point-to-point links with the following networks:

 R1 to R2: 20.0.0.0/30
 R2 to R3: 30.0.0.0/30

Configuration Summary

All PCs were assigned appropriate IP addresses within their subnet ranges:

PC1: 192.168.1.209 (HR)
PC2: 192.168.1.2 (SALES)
PC3: 192.168.1.3 (SALES)

Router interfaces were configured with IPs matching their connected LANs and inter-router links.

Static routes were added to each router to ensure full reachability to all other networks. This was important because each router only knows its directly connected networks, and static routing was used to manually define paths to the others.

For example:

R1 was configured with a route to 192.168.1.0/25 via R2
R2 was configured with a route to 192.168.1.208/28 via R1

This setup ensures that data from PC1 in the HR department can reach PC2 and PC3 in the Sales department through Router 1 and Router 2, and the reply packets can also return correctly along the reverse path.

Verification

Ping tests were successfully run:

From PC1 to PC2 and PC3
From PC2 and PC3 back to PC1

All communication was successful, confirming that IP routing was properly configured and functional across routers and departments.
