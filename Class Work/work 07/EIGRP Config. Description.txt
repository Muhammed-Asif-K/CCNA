EIGRP Network Configuration in Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates the configuration and testing of an EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) network in Cisco Packet Tracer.

   Steps Performed

1. Device Selection

    Added multiple routers, including empty routers (to support 4 interfaces).
    Added switches and PCs for LAN connectivity.

2. Topology Setup

   * Connected routers, switches, and PCs using appropriate cables.
   * Configured router-to-router connections using the network `200.10.X.0/24`.
   * Configured LAN networks using the `192.168.X.0/24` range.

3. IP Address Configuration

   * Assigned IP addresses to PCs.
   * Configured IP addresses for all router interfaces.

4. EIGRP Routing Configuration

   * Enabled and configured EIGRP on all routers to ensure dynamic routing between networks.

5. DHCP Configuration

   * Configured DHCP on routers to automatically assign IP addresses to PCs in each LAN.

6. Testing & Verification

   * Verified connectivity by pinging between all routers and PCs.
   * Shut down the main path to test the backup path functionality.
