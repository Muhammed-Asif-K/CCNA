In this work the question was to ping from PC1 to PC6 through Router 2 and the reply should come along through Router 4. likewise message from PC3 should go through Router 1 and Reply through Router 3 


Lab: IP Routing with Asymmetric Forward and Return Paths

Objective

The goal of this lab is to configure IP addressing and routing so that specific packets take asymmetric routes:

Packets from PC1 to PC6 should be forwarded via Router 2, and the reply should return via Router 4.
Packets from PC3 to PC5 should go via Router 1, and the reply should come via Router 3.

This demonstrates the use of policy-based routing or carefully managed static routes to control both the forward and return paths of network traffic.

Network Topology Overview

Four LANs are included in this design:

LAN 1 â€“ 192.168.1.0/26 (PC0, PC1)
LAN 2 â€“ 192.168.1.64/26 (PC4, PC5)
LAN 3 â€“ 192.168.1.128/26 (PC6, PC7)
LAN 4 â€“ 192.168.1.192/26 (PC2, PC3)

Routers:
R1, R2, R3, and R4 are the core routers connected using point-to-point subnets in the 200.10.x.x range.

Step-by-Step Configuration Summary

IP Addressing:

All PCs were assigned IPs from their respective subnets:

PC0: 192.168.1.2
PC1: 192.168.1.3
PC2: 192.168.1.194
PC3: 192.168.1.195
PC4: 192.168.1.67
PC5: 192.168.1.66
PC6: 192.168.1.130
PC7: 192.168.1.131


Routing Configuration:

On each router, static routes were configured to reach all remote networks. The key part of this configuration is directing the outgoing and incoming paths based on the specific routing requirement.

Example for PC1 to PC6:

* The path from PC1 should follow: R1 â†’ R2 â†’ R3 â†’ PC6
* The reply path should follow: PC6 â†’ R3 â†’ R4 â†’ R1 â†’ PC1

To achieve this, static routes were defined carefully:

* On R1, a route to 192.168.1.128/26 (PC6's network) points to R2 (via 200.10.1.1/30)
* On R6, a return route to 192.168.1.0/26 (PC1's network) is set via R4

Likewise, for PC3 to PC5:

* Forward path: PC3 â†’ R4 â†’ R1 â†’ R2 â†’ PC5
* Reply path: PC5 â†’ R2 â†’ R3 â†’ R4 â†’ PC3

To achieve this, R4 sends packets destined to PC5 through R1
And R2 sends reply packets to PC3 via R3

Asymmetric Routing Behavior

This routing logic ensures:

Traffic between PC1 and PC6 does not follow the same path in both directions.
It enforces a controlled and intentional routing behavior rather than relying on default shortest-path routing.

This is particularly useful in real-world scenarios where different routes have different bandwidths, latency, or policy restrictions.

---

Verification

Ping was tested between:

* PC1 and PC6 â€“ verified that packets go via R2 and return via R4
* PC3 and PC5 â€“ verified that packets go via R1 and return via R3

Ping replies were successfully received with correct routing behavior.
