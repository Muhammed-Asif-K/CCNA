RIP Routing Configuration – Cisco Packet Tracer Project

This network topology demonstrates the configuration of **Routing Information Protocol (RIP)** across four subnets using **three routers**, each connected to its own **local LAN** segment via switches. The objective is to allow **inter-network communication** between all end devices (PCs) using **RIP v1** or **RIP v2**.

Network Topology Overview:

The topology is divided into four LANs connected via three routers:

 Router0 → LAN 1 (192.168.1.0/26) → PC0, PC1
 Router1 → LAN 2 (192.168.2.0/26) → PC2, PC3
 Router2 → LAN 3 (192.168.3.0/26) → PC4, PC5
 Router2 → LAN 4 (192.168.4.0/26) → PC6, PC7
 Router interconnections:

    Router0 to Router1: 20.0.0.0/24
    Router1 to Router2: 30.0.0.0/24

Configuration Steps:

1. Assign IP Addresses to PCs:

     Use static IP addressing on all PCs based on their subnet.
     Example: `PC0` = 192.168.1.10/26, `Gateway` = 192.168.1.62

2.   Configure Router Interfaces:

     Assign IP addresses to all router interfaces based on connected networks.
     Example:

       `Router0` Gig0/0 = 1.62 (connected to Switch0)
       `Router0` Gig0/1 = 20.0.0.1 (connected to Router1)
       `Router1` Gig0/0 = 20.0.0.2
       `Router1` Gig0/1 = 2.62 (to LAN2)
       and so on...

3.   Enable RIP on Each Router:

   bash:-

   Router> enable
   Router# configure terminal
   Router(config)# router rip
   Router(config-router)# version 2
   Router(config-router)# network 192.168.X.0
   Router(config-router)# network 20.0.0.0
   Router(config-router)# network 30.0.0.0
   Router(config-router)# exit
   

     Replace `192.168.X.0` with appropriate local subnet(s) of each router.
     Include all directly connected networks in the RIP configuration.

4.   Testing the Network:

     After configuring RIP on all routers, use the `ping` command from each PC to every other PC to ensure successful routing.
     Example:

     bash:- 

     PC> ping 192.168.4.10
     

   ✅ Expected Output:

   All PCs in different LANs should be able to communicate.
   RIP should dynamically update and share route information between routers.
