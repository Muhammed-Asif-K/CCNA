DHCP with EIGRP Routing â€“ Cisco Packet Tracer Project
-------------------------------------------------------


This project simulates a centralized DHCP-based IP addressing system across multiple subnets, combined with EIGRP routing and DHCP relay (IP helper-address) configuration. The goal is to enable centralized IP allocation and dynamic routing across four different branch networks.



Network Topology Overview

    Central DHCP Server (IP: 1.150)
    Routers: Router1, Router2, Router3 (configured with EIGRP)
    Branch Networks:

    ðŸŸ¡ BGL (Bangalore) â€“ 192.168.1.0/24 â†’ PC0, PC1, PC2
    ðŸŸ¢ CHN (Chennai) â€“ 192.168.2.0/24 â†’ PC3, PC4, PC5
    ðŸŸ£ HYD (Hyderabad) â€“ 192.168.3.0/24 â†’ PC6, PC7, PC8
    ðŸ”µ KRL (Kerala) â€“ 192.168.6.0/24 â†’ PC9, PC10, PC11



Configuration Steps:

1.  Converted Router1 into a DHCP Server

     Created DHCP pools for each subnet:

     bash:-

     ip dhcp pool BGL
     network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
     default-router 192.168.1.1
     dns-server 8.8.8.8

     ip dhcp pool CHN
     network 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0
     default-router 192.168.2.1

     ip dhcp pool HYD
     network 192.168.3.0 255.255.255.0
     default-router 192.168.3.1

     ip dhcp pool KRL
     network 192.168.6.0 255.255.255.0
     default-router 192.168.6.1
     

2. Configured Interface IPs on All Routers

     Example for Router1:

     bash:- 

     interface Gig0/0
     ip address 1.100 255.255.255.0
     no shutdown

     interface Gig0/1
     ip address 4.1 255.255.255.0

     interface Fa0/2
     ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
     

3.  Configured DHCP Relay (Helper Address) on Router2 and Router3

     Because routers do not forward broadcast messages (like DHCP Discover), the ip helper-address command is used to relay DHCP requests:

     bash:-

     interface Fa0/1
     ip helper-address 1.150
     

4.  Enabled EIGRP Routing (AS 100) on All Routers and DHCP Router

     Example:

     bash:-

     router eigrp 100
     network 1.0.0.0
     network 4.0.0.0
     network 192.168.1.0
     no auto-summary
     

5. Assigned IP Addresses to All PCs via DHCP

     On each PC:

     * Go to Desktop > IP Configuration
     * Select DHCP
     * PC should receive an IP address, default gateway, and subnet mask automatically.
    Example:

     * PC0 gets IP from 192.168.1.0/24 with default gateway 192.168.1.1
     * PC4 gets IP from 192.168.2.0/24 with gateway 192.168.2.1
     * etc.



 âœ… Final Outcome:

* All PCs in the topology received IP addresses dynamically from the centralized DHCP server.
* EIGRP routing enabled full connectivity across all networks.
* DHCP relay allowed DHCP broadcasts from other subnets to reach the DHCP server as unicast.



> This project models a scalable enterprise network where IP addressing is centrally managed and routing is efficiently handled using EIGRP with proper DHCP relay setup.
