 Lab: Static Routing with Floating Static Routes (Failover Paths)

🖥️ Objective

To assign IP addresses to all PCs and router interfaces, and configure static routing on routers with multiple paths. The network should always prefer the shortest/best path, and automatically switch to second-best or third-best paths if the better ones go down, using floating static routes based on administrative distance.

🧱 Network Topology Summary

Three LANs:

BNG – 192.168.1.0/24 (PC0)
CHN – 192.168.2.0/24 (PC2)
DEL – 192.168.12.0/24 (PC4)
HYD – 192.168.11.0/24 (PC6)

Core Routers:

Routers are interconnected in a mesh-like fashion with 3 paths between end networks:

Best Path (Middle)
2nd Best Path (Lower)
3rd Best Path (Upper)


Step-by-Step Configuration Summary

1️⃣ IP Addressing

Assigned IP addresses to all PC devices using their respective subnet:

PC0: 192.168.1.x/24
PC2: 192.168.2.x/24
PC4: 192.168.12.x/24
PC6: 192.168.11.x/24

Configured IP addresses on all router interfaces as per diagram. Example:

R0 Gig0/0: 1.100
R1 Gig0/0: 6.2
R1 Gig1/0: 7.1
R2 Gig0/0: 7.2, and so on

Each interface between routers was configured with a point-to-point IP range for clear routing.

2️⃣ Static Routing Setup

Static routes were added to each router for all remote networks that are not directly connected.

On each router, I defined the best path (lowest administrative distance) first, and then added:

A 2nd best route with a slightly higher administrative distance (e.g., 10)
A 3rd backup route with even higher administrative distance (e.g., 20)

This ensures:

The center path is chosen first by default
If that goes down, the route will fall back to the lower path
If both are down, it will finally switch to the upper path

3️⃣ Floating Static Route Logic

Example on Router 0 (R0):

command :-

ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 6.2       
ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 8.2 2   
ip route 192.168.2.0 255.255.255.0 3.2 3  
```

The router always checks and uses the route with lowest distance (default is 1)
If the next hop goes down, it checks the next available route based on increasing AD

Path Prioritization

Best Path (Shortest):
R0 → R1 → R2 → CHN

2nd Best Path:
R0 → R3 → R4 → R2 → CHN

3rd Path (Backup):
R0 → R5 → R6 → R2 → CHN

These were prioritized by distance and configured with appropriate floating static routes.

---

Testing & Failover Verification

Verified reachability from PC0 (BNG) to all other PCs using ping
Shut down interfaces on the best path to simulate failure and confirmed:

2nd best path was used when best path was down
3rd path was used when both best and second-best paths were down
