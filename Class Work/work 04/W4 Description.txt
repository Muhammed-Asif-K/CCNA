Lab: IP Routing with Asymmetric Forward and Return Paths + Default Routing Extension

Objective

The goal of this lab is twofold:

1. Asymmetric Routing: Configure IP addressing and static routing so that specific packets take asymmetric paths:
   - PC1 to PC6 should go via Router 2, and reply should return via Router 4.
   - PC3 to PC5 should go via Router 1, and reply should come back via Router 3.

2. Default Routing: Extend the network by adding two new routers connected to the Facebook and Google subnets. These routers should forward unknown traffic using default routes into the core network.

Network Topology Overview

Original Core LANs:
- LAN 1: 192.168.1.0/26 (PC0, PC1)
- LAN 2: 192.168.1.64/26 (PC4, PC5)
- LAN 3: 192.168.1.128/26 (PC6, PC7)
- LAN 4: 192.168.1.192/26 (PC2, PC3)

Core Routers: R1, R2, R3, R4
Inter-router links use subnets in the 200.10.x.x/30 range.

Newly Added LANs:
- Facebook LAN: 10.10.10.0/25 (PC8, PC9) via new router
- Google LAN: 10.10.10.128/25 (PC10, PC11) via new router

Routing Configuration

Asymmetric Routing:

Example 1 – PC1 to PC6:
- Forward Path: PC1 → R1 → R2 → R3 → PC6
- Reply Path: PC6 → R3 → R4 → R1 → PC1

Example 2 – PC3 to PC5:
- Forward Path: PC3 → R4 → R1 → R2 → PC5
- Reply Path: PC5 → R2 → R3 → R4 → PC3

Static routes were carefully configured on all routers to direct traffic accordingly without dynamic protocols.

Default Routing for Facebook & Google:

1. Facebook Router (yellow section):
   - Subnet: 10.10.10.0/25
   - Connected to PCs: PC8 (10.2), PC9 (10.3)
   - Default route used:
     ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.1.1.17

2. Google Router (blue section):
   - Subnet: 10.10.10.128/25
   - Connected to PCs: PC10 (10.130), PC11 (10.131)
   - Default route used:
     ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.129

These default routes ensure that any traffic from the Facebook or Google LANs not destined for their own subnet is sent to the core network, enabling full communication without complex static configurations.

Verification

- PC1 to PC6 communication verified via asymmetric path (R2 forward, R4 return).
- PC3 to PC5 communication verified (R1 forward, R3 return).
- PC8/PC9 (Facebook) and PC10/PC11 (Google) were successfully able to ping core devices through their respective default gateways.
