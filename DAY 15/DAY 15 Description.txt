Day 15 Lab Description

In this lab, we practiced basic router configuration, IP addressing, subnetting, interface activation, and static routing on two routers (R1 and R2).

Key tasks performed:

 Configured IP addresses on multiple GigabitEthernet interfaces on both routers.
 Applied subnet masks to create multiple subnets (using /26, /28, /30).
 Brought interfaces up using the `no shutdown` command.
 Verified interface status with `show ip interface brief`.
 Configured static routes to enable communication between different subnets connected through the routers.
 Corrected routing mistakes using `no ip route` where needed.

This lab reinforced practical skills in:

 Interface configuration commands (`interface`, `ip address`, `no shutdown`)
 Subnet mask calculation and addressing
 Basic routing table setup using `ip route`
