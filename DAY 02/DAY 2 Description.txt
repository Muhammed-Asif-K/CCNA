 Day 2 – CCNA Lab Work: Device Interconnection Practice

In this lab, I practiced connecting different network devices (routers, switches, PCs, and a server) using the correct types of cables and proper port configurations. The goal was to understand physical connections, especially for different cable lengths and device types.

Devices & Connections

Routers:

R1 is connected to R2 using a copper cross-over cable (50 meters).
R1 is connected to R3 using a fiber connection (3 kilometers).
R3 is connected to R4 with a copper straight-through cable (250 meters).

Router-to-Switch Connections:

R2 connects to SW1 and SW2 using copper straight-through cables.
R4 connects to SW5 and SW6 using copper straight-through cables.

Switch-to-Switch Connections:

SW1 ↔ SW2
SW1 ↔ SW3
SW2 ↔ SW4
SW5 ↔ SW6
SW5 ↔ SW7
SW6 ↔ SW8
All these used copper straight-through cables.

Switch-to-End Devices:

SW3 connected to PC1
SW4 connected to PC2
SW7 connected to PC3
SW8 connected to SRV1
These also used straight-through cables (PC/server to switch).

 Notes :

Auto MDI-X was assumed disabled, so I used cross-over cables when connecting similar devices (e.g., Router-Router).
I kept in mind the appropriate cable type based on distance: fiber for long distances and copper for short.
Since Packet Tracer doesn’t differentiate between single-mode or multi-mode fiber, I just followed general real-world rules in choosing fiber for R1-R3 (3 km).
