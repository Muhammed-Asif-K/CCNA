 CCNA Day 1 Lab – Network Topology Build

 Lab Objective

Recreate the provided network diagram in Cisco Packet Tracer to understand basic enterprise branch connectivity and security layering.

 Network Scenario

New York Branch:

   Devices: 2 PCs (PC1, PC2), 1 Cisco 2960 Switch (SW1), 1 Cisco 2911 Router (R1)
Tokyo Branch:

   Devices: 2 Servers (SRV1, SRV2), 1 Cisco 2960 Switch (SW2), 1 Cisco 2911 Router (R2)
Firewalls:

   Cisco ASA 5505 Firewalls (FW1 and FW2) between the routers and the cloud (Internet) for security filtering.
Internet Cloud:

   Connects both branches and is accessible to an attacker laptop for simulating threat scenarios.
Attacker:

   A Laptop device is connected to the cloud to simulate an external attacker, which will be used in later labs for studying packet inspection and mitigation techniques.

 Devices Used

* Cisco 2911 Routers (x2)
* Cisco 2960 Switches (x2)
* Cisco ASA 5505 Firewalls (x2)
* PCs (x2)
* Servers (x2)
* Laptop (attacker simulation)

 Key Concepts Practiced

✅ Understanding branch network structure and segmentation.
✅ Placement and purpose of firewalls for perimeter security.
✅ Use of cloud representation for WAN connections between branches.
✅ Preparing topology for further labs involving routing, ACL, NAT, and attack simulation.
